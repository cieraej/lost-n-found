## Technical Details
* Unity : [2019.2.9f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.2.9) 
* Oculus Rift

## Summary
> Using Unity, build a VR app for Oculus Rift that does the following:
The app places the user at the center of a virtual room and reveals a "base" element in front of the user.
10 additional elements are randomly spawned around the user at distances between 0.5 to 2 meters from the user.
(The elements can be below and above the user, although not beyond the floor, walls or ceiling) 
The user is tasked with finding these objects in a specific order, with the assistance of the app, and returning them to the base element.
The user experience as well as the quality of code will be evaluated.

## Things to Consider:

> Finding and returning the objects to the base should be unchallenging. Assist the user in locating them.
Use whatever techniques you can to make the task intuitive without resorting to explicit instructions.
All interactions, including how the spawned items are returned to the base, are up to you.
Account for users who get lost and are unable to complete the task.
How the experience is presented is up to you.
